    // for that we can say if .. localStorage .. and we want to get the item of profile .. thats where we
    // store the token .. so, if that exists .. then we want to add something to our request .. that
    // something is going to be req.headers.Authorization
    // remember if we go to back-end and take a look at our middleware .. we can see that .. we are taking
    // something from req.headers.Authorization .. So, in here we need to put our token ..
    // and the token is going to be string .. and it needs to start with the word Bearer .. so this is going
    // to be a Bare token .. 2nd thing hocche divided by a space is the actual token .. we can get that by
    // saying json.parse .. inside of there .. we get the localStorage.getItem .. we get the profile .. and

// have to specify the starting part of this url..so, how do we change that .. well now .. its not going to be
// api.get .. forward slash URL .. it is simply going to be /posts ...we always have to add that ..
// we did that .. so that .. later on we can use some more advanced features of axios .. some of the features
// that are not often mentioned .. in easy tutorials ..and are definitely a good thing to know .. before that
// though .. let's simply create the routes .. for the sign in and the sign out ..

//now we have to focus on adding redux capabilities..bcz all actions towards our backend are going to be done..using redux
// we need to dispatch those actions.. to do that, we have to add some boilerplate code meaning, we do have to create
// a few files and folders but later on, on bigger applications this is going to be extremely great .. because of the
// scalability and as our application grows , we will be able to use that same old consistency .. redux offers us without
// any trouble .. So, to do that we are first going to create a folder called actions

// take one parameter (newPost) .. that parameter is going to be the entire post .. after we got the post
// .. we can say
/// ðŸ”´ðŸ”µexport const createPost = (newPost) => axios.post(url, newPost);
export const createPost = (newPost) => API.post("/posts", newPost);
// url, then we have to specify the data we are sending .. after exporting .. we can go back to Actions...
// Folder Action ... file posts.js ..
